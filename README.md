# 🛫 Airlines Revenue & Occupancy Optimization Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes an airline company's operational and financial data to address profitability challenges.  
The focus is on **increasing occupancy rates** to boost revenue without compromising customer satisfaction or safety.

## 💼 Business Problem
The airline faces shrinking profit margins due to:
- Stricter environmental regulations
- Higher flight taxes
- Rising fuel and labor costs
- Tight labor market

**Objective:** Use data analysis to identify opportunities for increasing occupancy rates and optimizing pricing to maximize revenue.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Aircraft types with more than 100 seats and their seating capacities identified.
- SU9 aircraft generated the highest revenue due to competitive ticket pricing.
- CN1 aircraft had the lowest revenue due to limited facilities and only economy class.
- Comfort class was available only on aircraft 773.
- Business class fares were consistently higher than economy class across all aircraft.
- Increasing occupancy rates by 10% can significantly raise total revenue.

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Basic seat capacity analysis
- Ticket booking and revenue trend analysis
- Fare condition comparisons (business, economy, comfort)
